# What is BitHub?
BitHub is a simple web-based (PHP, your choice of host [LAMP, etc.]) file server with support for unlimited filetypes, files, and even web-based editing! 

# Installation
Simply drag and drop these files (this whole repo!) onto an existing webserver.
Note: Your PHP server settings (max_post_size) will dictate/limit the file size! Change your php.ini to change this value.
